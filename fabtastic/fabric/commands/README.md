# Fabric Commands

The modules in this package can be imported in their entirety:

    from fabtastic.fabric.commands import *
    
or selectively imported:

    from fabtastic.fabric.commands.c_common import *
    from fabtastic.fabric.commands.c_git import git_pull
    
We could waste space here describing what each module does, but generally,
each is named after the software they work with or help deploy.
